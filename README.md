NLP (Natural Langiage Processing) is one of the most important parts of Data Science and I have worked with a dataset based on reviews.
Reviews are quite important for lots of companies especially the ones in customer services. As data scientist, I implemented NLP techniques in R Studio
in order to analyze reviews.
